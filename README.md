A basic Python project demonstrating data management principles. Uses two files, Adkar1_info and vaccine, to store and retrieve Aadhar card details. Explore data interaction and retrieval in Python.

Features: Data Storage: The Adhar1_info.py file is responsible for storing Aadhar card details including name, age, mobile number, and more. Data Retrieval: The vaccine.py file interacts with the Adkar1_info.py data to retrieve and display Aadhar card details based on user input.

Files: Adkar1_info.py: This file contains the class and methods for storing Aadhar card details in a data structure. vaccine.py: The file that interacts with Adkar1_info to retrieve and display Aadhar card details. adharcard.db: The SQLite database file where data is stored

Instructions: Clone the repository using git clone. Run the vaccine.py script to access Aadhar card details based on user input. Follow the prompts to input an Aadhar number and view the corresponding details.

Note: This project serves as a demonstration of data management concepts in Python. While it does not utilize Flask, it showcases the interaction between modules for data storage and retrieval.# Python-DB_Project
